# EAMapping

This projects aim to provide a simple way of accessing Enterprise Architect projects through a Java API.

Internally, the Hibernate object-relational mapping framework is used to provide access to the persisted EA project.

## Build
The project uses Gradle for dependency and build management.
The pre-configured Gradle Wrapper script allows for simple one-step building:

    # On Linux and Mac OS
    ./gradlew build
  
    # On Windows
    ./gradlew.bat build
